* OceanBar
** A Mac OS X Digital Ocean Client

* Note
This is currently in a non-working state as I'm transitioning from DigitalOcean API V1 to DigitalOcean API V2


   
This is a Mac OS X Client for the Digital Ocean API
It is compatible with 10.9. 10.8 support requires switching to AFNetworking 1.X (see todo list).

** Features

- [X] Menubar App
- [X] List active and inactive machines
- [X] Power Cycle, Shutdown, Reboot, Power Off/On and Destroy machines
- [X] Open machines ip addresses in the browser on various ports.
- [X] Get notification for changes in the Notification Center
- [X] Define reload interval in the preferences
- [X] Prepared for localization
  
I know that there're by now other Digital Ocean Menubar apps for the Mac, but I had already half finished this one when the first other apps were released, and since I was quite happy with the data model I decided to just continue along the path and add some more functions.

I'm planning to add more features to this app (as listed below) but for now it supports all the necessities required to use it as a good digital ocean menubar control.

** Installation

You'll need [[http://cocoapods.org/][CocoaPods]] to compile this project:
1. Checkout the repository
2. Jump into a terminal and go into the directory
3. Run 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pod install
#+END_SRC
4. Open 'OceanBar.xcworkspace' in Xcode
5. Open kDigitalOceanClientKey.h and enter your DigitalOcean Credentials
6. Compile, Run & Success
   
** Mac App Store Installation

This app can be downloaded for free from the Mac App Store:
https://itunes.apple.com/app/id871852326

So if you don't want to mess with installing Xcode and whatnot, you can just conveniently download the binary from the Mac App Store.

* Todo
- [ ] Detect it if the internet connection goes away *and* comes back again
- [x] Filter for additional droplet state: "new", which means - just created
- [ ] Add functionality to snapshot machines
- [ ] Add functionality to restore machines from snapshots
- [ ] Add support for snapshot / image administration
- [ ] See if it is possible to list backups / snapshots for machines. This would make it easier to destroy machines as we'd know that we have a snapshot from it.
- [ ] Localize to other languages (any takers?)
- [ ] Port back to AFNetworking 1.X so that it also runs on 10.8. This seems to be the only roadblock for 10.8 compatibility.
