I know that there're by now other Digital Ocean Menubar apps for the Mac, but I had already half finished this one when the first other apps were released, and since I was quite happy with the data model I decided to just continue along the path and add some more functions.

I'm planning to add more features to this app (as listed below) but for now it supports all the necessities required to use it as a good digital ocean menubar control.

* Todo
- [x] Filter for additional droplet state: "new", which means - just created
- [ ] Add functionality to snapshot machines
- [ ] Add functionality to restore machines from snapshots
- [ ] Add support for snapshot / image administration
- [ ] See if it is possible to list backups / snapshots for machines. This would make it easier to destroy machines as we'd know that we have a snapshot from it.
- [ ] Localize to other languages (any takers?)
