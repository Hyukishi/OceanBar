* OceanBar
** A Mac OS X Digital Ocean Client
   
This is a Mac OS X Client for the Digital Ocean API
It should be compatible with 10.9 and 10.8. Maybe even 10.7, but I don't have 10.7 machines for testing anymore.

** Features

- [X] Menubar App
- [X] List active and inactive machines
- [X] Power Cycle, Shutdown, Reboot, Power Off/On and Destroy machines
- [X] Open machines ip addresses in the browser on various ports.
- [X] Get notification for changes in the Notification Center
- [X] Define reload interval in the preferences
- [X] Prepared for localization
  
I know that there're by now other Digital Ocean Menubar apps for the Mac, but I had already half finished this one when the first other apps were released, and since I was quite happy with the data model I decided to just continue along the path and add some more functions.

I'm planning to add more features to this app (as listed below) but for now it supports all the necessities required to use it as a good digital ocean menubar control.

* Todo
- [ ] Add functionality to snapshot machines
- [ ] Add functionality to restore machines from snapshots
- [ ] Figure out why there is no "Image" information for any of my machines
- [ ] Add support for snapshot / image administration
- [ ] See if it is possible to list backups / snapshots for machines. This would make it easier to destroy machines as we'd know that we have a snapshot from it.
- [ ] Localize to other languages (any takers?)
